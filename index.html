          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Poverty, Age, and  Income</h2>
          <p>When examining this data we see several correlations forming between various health risks and demographic factors. 
            This data looks at the amount of each risk and factor that occurs in a given state. </p> 
             <p>We will first examine poverty. States with higher levels of poverty have more people without insurance. There is a slight 
            positive association between poverty and smoking, meaning in areas where there is more poverty slightly more people 
            smokers. Similarly, in states where there is more poverty there tends to be more obesity. 
          </p>

          <p>We will next examine age. Most states have a median age of 36-40. In general, states with higher median ages tend to have lower rates
            of uninsurance. Florida is a noteable exception with a median age of 41.6 and 17.6% of the population lacking insurance. Percentage of smokers
            in a state tends to be higher in states with higher median ages. Similarly states with higher median ages tend to have higher rates of obesity. 
            However, this correlation is not very strong. 
          </p>

          <p>Finally, we will examine income. States with higher median incomes tend to have lower rates of uninsurance. This corroberates our conclusion that States
            with more poverty (therefore lower incomes) have more uninsurance. Higher median income is also strongly correlated to lower levels of smoking. 
          Finally, obesity rates are lower in states with higher median incomes.  </p>

          <p>Overall, it appears that higher median incomes and therefore lower poverty rates correlates with fewer health risks. In conclusion,
            at least when it comes with health risks Biggie Smalls was wrong, mo' money does not equal mo' problems.
